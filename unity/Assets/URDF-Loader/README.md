# unity urdf-loader

Utilities for loading URDF files and STL geometry into Unity

![Example](../docs/unity-example.gif)

## Use
```cs
StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(".../path/to/urdf");
string content = reader.ReadToEnd();
URDFJointList ujl = URDFParser.BuildRobot(".../package/dir", content);
```

### API
#### URDFParser.LoadURDFRobot(package, urdfpath, loadmeshFunction)
Reads and processes the urdf at the given path, returning a `URDFJointList` that describes the whole robot.

##### package
The path representing the package:// directory to load package:// relative files.

##### urdf
The path to the URDF file relative to the specified package directory.

##### loadmeshFunction
An optional function for loading geometry in a custom way or in unsupported formats. `URDFLoader.LoadMesh` is used by default.

#### URDFParser.BuildRobot(package, urdfcontent, loadMeshFunction)
Same function as above, but this function takes the raw contents of the urdf file rather than a path.

#### URDFJointList.SetAngle(name, rad)
Sets the angle (in radians) of the joint with the given name. Throws an error if the joint does not exist.

#### URDFJointList.TrySetAngle(name, rad)
Same as above, but does not throw an error.

#### URDFJointList.GetAnglesAsDictionary()
Returns a new `Dictionary<string, float>` with the current angle of all the joints on the robot.

#### URDFJointList.SetAnglesFromDictionary(angles)
Takes a `Dictionary<string, float>` and sets all the angles on the robot that are listed in the dictionary.

## Limitations
- The Collada model loader currently does not support textures or materials and loads the models with an offset rotation ([#52](Issue https://github.com/gkjohnson/urdf-loaders/issues/52))
