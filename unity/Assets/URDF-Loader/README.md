Utilities for loading URDF files and STL geometry into Unity

![Example](../docs/unity-example.gif)

## Use
```cs
StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(".../path/to/urdf");
string content = reader.ReadToEnd();
URDFRobot ur = URDFLoader.BuildRobot(".../package/dir", content);
```

## API
### URDFLoader
#### LoadRobot(urdfPath, package, loadmeshFunction) : URDFRobot
Reads and processes the urdf at the given path, returning a `URDFRobot` that describes the whole robot.

##### urdfpath : String
The path to the URDF file relative to the specified package directory.

##### package : String
The path representing the package:// directory to load package:// relative files.

##### loadmeshFunction : System.Action<string, string, System.Action<GameObject[]>>
An optional function for loading geometry in a custom way or in unsupported formats. `URDFLoader.LoadMesh` is used by default.

The function is passed a path to the model, the models file extension and a callback to pass an array of game objects when finished.

#### BuildRobot(urdfContent, package, workingPath, loadMeshFunction, jointList) : URDFRobot
Same function as above, but this function takes the raw contents of the urdf file rather than a path.

##### urdfContent : String

The urdf content to parse into a robot.

##### package : String

See `LoadURDFRobot`.

##### workingPath : String

The directory to use to resolve relative file paths in the URDF.

##### loadMeshFunction : System.Action<string, string, System.Action<GameObject[]>>

See `LoadURDFRobot`.

##### jointList : URDFRobot

An existing URDFRobot to build the robot in to.

#### URDFRobot.SetAngle(name, rad)
Sets the angle (in radians) of the joint with the given name. Throws an error if the joint does not exist.

#### URDFRobot.TrySetAngle(name, rad) : Boolean
Same as above, but does not throw an error. Returns `true` if it was able to set the angle.

#### URDFRobot.GetAnglesAsDictionary() : Dictionary<string, float>
Returns a new `Dictionary<string, float>` with the current angle of all the joints on the robot.

#### URDFRobot.SetAnglesFromDictionary(angles)
Takes a `Dictionary<string, float>` and sets all the angles on the robot that are listed in the dictionary.

## Limitations
- The Collada model loader currently does not support textures or materials and loads the models with an offset rotation ([Issue #52](https://github.com/gkjohnson/urdf-loaders/issues/52))
